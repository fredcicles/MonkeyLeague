## Traits & Attributes

Each Monkey NFT is born with its own unique genetic composition, based on a total of 32 traits and attributes — eleven Appearance, an Alpha Score, four game Skills, starting and Max Potential game Skill levels, and twelve game Perks, or action boosters.

### Appearance Traits

The Appearance traits all range from Common to Rare to Epic to Legendary and the potential permutations of all traits amount to nearly 2.5 trillion possibilities. After the initial game launch, there will also be Special Moves, and the higher your Monkey’s Alpha Score, the higher likelihood your Monkey will be able to execute that move.

A Monkey’s Appearance is formulated from eleven different traits plus an Alpha score. Each of the eleven traits then has numerous options under each. These traits and trait variations form your Monkey’s overall Appearance.

Trait | Variations
---|---
Hair Style | 22
Ear Type | ?
Eye Type | ?
Nose Type | ?
Mouth Type | 10
Outfit Style | 35
Pattern Type | ?
Arm Type | ?
Color Palette | ?
Tattoo Type | ?
Leg Type | ?


### Rarity
Each option of the appearance traits has a rarity:
- Common
- Rare
- Epic
- Legendary

### Alpha Score
Represents the probability that that combined set of traits will be generated.  The higher the Alpha Score, the less likely this exact Monkey will be drafted.  Alpha Scores for Gen Zero range from ~180–800.

### Core Game Skills

Each Monkey is born with four in-game Skills — Accuracy, Control, Passing, and Defense — and a starting stat and a Max Potential for each. The minimum Skills stat is 10.

In the game, your goal will be to improve your Monkeys’ Skill levels through matchplay and completing missions. Improving their Skills and your match performance not only empowers you to climb the ranks and achieve higher earning levels in the game but it also increases your NFT’s XP and value.

>Example:
The Passing stat represents how well of a Pass your Monkey makes and whether it will be successful reaching your other player, then the chance of that Pass succeeding is also impacted by the opposing player’s Defense stat, which represents how well that Monkey defends against passes and shots.

Game Skill | Description
--- | ---
Accuracy | Determines how likely their passes and shots are to succeed.
Passing | Determines how well you pass and the likelihood of your pass will successfully reach its target. The higher your passing level, the more likely it will succeed.
Defense | Influences how well that player defends against passes, shots, and other gameplay situations.
Control | Represents their ability to handle various situations; receiving a pass successfully, shooting the ball, or for example, better control from defenders trying to take the ball from you.

### Max Potential of Core Game Skills

Max Potential range from 75 to 100.  The range of combined Max Potentials among Generation Zero is between 300 and 400.

- Max Accuracy
- Max Passing
- Max Defense
- Max Control

---

### Field Positions
Each Monkey is born to be better suited at one of the positions. That is realized once all core game Skills reach each of their Max Potentials.

- Striker
- Midfielder
- Defender
- Goalkeeper

---

### Game Perks (12)

There are a total of 12 in-Game Perks, or boosts of in game moves, three under each position of Striker, Midfielder, Defender, and Goalie.

Each Monkey is born with a certain percentage boost for each Perk. The minimum and maximum boost from each Perk is between 0.01 and 0.25, respectively (1–25%). The Perk boost percentages are then combined to form the overall boost for each Position.

Field Position's Perks | Min Perk Combination | Max Perk Combination
--- | ---| ---
Striker | 0.05 | 0.63
Defender | 0.05 | 0.60
Midfielder | 0.05 | 0.59
Goalkeeper | 0.04 | 0.58

Perks are not initiated by the player, as like with a move, but rather automatically take effect when performing a certain move in the right zone. 
>For example, if your Monkey is in the attack zone and you choose to shoot on goal then your Monkey’s Precision Shot perk will automatically boost that shot’s precision based on the percentage of the Precision Shot Perk.

Perks are boosters to specific game actions on the field.

Field Position | Game Perk | Description
--- | --- | ---
Striker | Precision Shot | Boosts shot on goal with extra accuracy
Striker | Protective Holding | Boosts your Monkey’s ability to control the situation
Striker | Hard Header | Boosts your Monkey’s header power
Midfielder | Flank Pass | Boosts your Monkey’s ability to accurately pass across the field to another Monkey teammate
Midfielder | Extreme Pressing | Increases your Monkey’s defensive press impact on the opposing player
Midfielder | Pass Interception | Increases your Monkey’s ability to intercept passes
Defender | Hard Tackle | Boosts your Monkey’s tackling abilities
Defender | Defensive Awareness | Boosts your Monkey’s defensive awareness of surroundings and actions — faster to react
Defender | Last Stand Defense | Increases your Monkey’s ability to stage a last stand protection of or near your goal area from the opposing team
Goalkeeper | Golden Gloves | Boosts the Goalie’s ability to defend the goal and block shots
